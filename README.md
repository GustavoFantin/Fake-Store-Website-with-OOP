# Fake-Store-Website-with-OOP
I developed in just one week a fake store website for a college project, using JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to fetch and display data from an API. The site fetches and displays product data from an API, offering a fully functional shopping cart where users can add or remove items, track the total number of products, and see real-time price updates. The project demonstrates clean code structure, modularity, and dynamic UI interactions.
