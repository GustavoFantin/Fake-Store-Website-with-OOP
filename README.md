# Fake-Store-Website-with-OOP
I developed a fake store website for a college project, using JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to fetch and display data from an API. The project included a shopping cart feature where users could add or remove items, view the total number of products, and see the updated total price dynamically.
